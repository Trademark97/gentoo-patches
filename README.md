# gentoo-patches
My attempts to patch Gentoo packages, in order to fix various issues.  
I make **no** guarantee that these patches will work on your setup, and should  
you choose to apply them, be aware that you do so at your own risk.  
Also, be aware that patches may become obsoleted, and I may not always clean  
this repository on a regular basis. I will, however, do my best to mark the  
package version that was patched, and what condition I was seeking to bypass.
